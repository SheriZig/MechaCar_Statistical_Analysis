## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
Which Variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg vales in the dataset?
Vehicle_length
Ground_clearance

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or Why not?

No, the p-value 5.35e-11 for the linear model is below the significance level of 0.05 indicating that there is not sufficient evidence that our null hypothesis is not true. The variance is most likely not random. 

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechCar prototypes effectively? Why or Why not?
Yes, the R-squared value predicts a 71.4% accuracy
